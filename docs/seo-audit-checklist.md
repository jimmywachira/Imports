# SEO Audit Checklist (Quick)

- Page titles are unique and match search intent for Kenya car imports.
- Meta descriptions are present and reflect the page content.
- One clear H1 per page; headings follow a logical hierarchy (H2/H3).
- Internal links connect top pages (cars, inspection, shipping, trade-in).
- Images use descriptive alt text and load quickly.
- Canonical URLs are set and consistent with the live domain.
- Sitemap and robots.txt are accessible and up to date.
- Structured data validates (Organization, WebSite, SearchAction).
- Pages load fast on mobile and avoid layout shifts.
- No index for admin pages or private content.

## Suggested Content Tweaks (Top Landing Pages)

- Cars listing page: add a short intro with Kenya-focused import phrases and links to inspection, shipping, and trade-in.
- Search landing page: add a brief summary describing direct Japan imports, inspection reports, and customs support.
- Inspection page: mention "inspection reports" and "Japanese auction grading" early in the first paragraph.
- Shipping page: mention "shipping and customs clearing from Japan to Kenya" in the opening section.
- Advisory page: include "taxi business advisory" in the hero copy and one secondary heading.

## Ongoing Actions

- Publish 1-2 vehicle spotlight articles per month targeting model + year + Kenya.
- Keep inventory updated; remove sold cars from the sitemap as you already do.
- Track top queries in Search Console and refine page copy quarterly.
